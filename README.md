# Sukiru - スキル

A website we built to measure developers’ progress and guide them through the most in-demand technologies in job applications. The data is based on [a small analysis we conducted on the Algerian job market](https://alex17ryan.github.io/A-Job-Market-Analysis/).

Shout out to [Meriem](https://github.com/maxviiiy) for building the frontend side of this project.

Go to [sukiru.vercel.app](https://sukiru.vercel.app/) right now to see your results!
